## 1. Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Dynamic Routing Optimization for Delay-Sensitive Applications

- **Published in**: GLOBECOM 2023 - 2023 IEEE Global Communications Conference

### Abstract

With the rapid development of the Internet and the approaching of the next-generation networking, the number and variety of delay-sensitive applications have increased dramatically. Nowadays, how to properly route delay-sensitive packets in complex network environment and meet the stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of delay-sensitive applications remains a great challenge. Towards this end, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based routing algorithm for delay-sensitive applications featuring the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method and the front-convergent actor-critic network (FCACN) technique. To meet the high demand of delay-sensitive applications, we consider the packet survival time (ST) to help our algorithm perform better and make up for the shortage of the time-to-live (TTL) mechanism in IP network. We conduct extensive experiments to prove the efficiency and reliability of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms two traditional routing protocols and two state-of-the-art DRL-based routing algorithms in terms of minimizing delay and packet loss rate.

## 2. RL4NET++: A Packet-Level Network Simulation Framework for DRL-Based Routing Algorithms

- **Published in**: 2023 8th IEEE International Conference on Network Intelligence and Digital Content (IC-NIDC)

### Abstract

As the rising complexity for network simulation and the development of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), existing network simulation frameworks cannot meet the high demand for DRL-based simulation. To solve this issue, we propose RL4NeT++, a packet-level network simulation framework based on OMNeT++ for DRL-based routing algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, RL4NeT++ is the first network simulation framework that takes asynchronous updating strategy into consideration and applies it for consistence to the training logic of DRL. In addition, RL4NeT++ has fast simulation and training speed, user-friendly interface, diverse network configurations, high modularization, convenient customization, and strong adaptability. We run extensive experiments to demonstrate the application of RL4NeT++ in DRL-based routing algorithm and prove the high simulation speed and strong adaptability of RL4NeT++.
